<h2>Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)</h2>
<p>
  DVWA stands for Damn Vulnerable Web Application, and it's a PHP/MySQL web application in Kali Linux that helps people learn about web application security. 
  It's designed for educational and training purposes, and it allows users to practice and improve their skills by simulating real-world security scenarios. 
  DVWA offers a controlled environment where users can experiment with various hacking techniques and learn how to defend against them. DVWA covers a wide range of 
  vulnerability types, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, and remote file inclusion. It has both documented and undocumented 
  vulnerabilities, and it offers different security levels to choose from, including low, medium, high, and impossible.
</p>

<h2>Command Injection</h2>
<p>
  Command injection is a cyber attack that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a host operating system through a vulnerable application. 
  This can happen when an application passes unsafe user input, such as forms, cookies, or HTTP headers, to a system shell. The attacker can then extend the 
  application's default functionality to pass commands to the system shell without injecting malicious code. 
</p>

<h2>SQL Injection</h2>
<p>
  SQL injection, or SQLi, is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate a database by inserting malicious SQL statements into an application's 
  entry field. SQL injection attacks can exploit security vulnerabilities in an application's software, such as when user input is not strongly typed or is 
  incorrectly filtered.

<h2>Install DVWA in kali linux</h2>
<p>sudo apt-get install -y dvwa</p>
